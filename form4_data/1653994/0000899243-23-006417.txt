(&quot;RBI&quot;) or cash amount determined by reference to the weighted average trading price of RBI's common shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the last business day prior to the exchange date, at the sole discretion of the general partner of RBI LP (subject to the consent of the RBI conflicts committee, in certain circumstances). This conversion right has no expiration date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">3G Restaurant Brands Holdings General Partner Ltd. is the general partner of 3G Restaurant Brands Holdings LP (&quot;3G RBH&quot;). Accordingly, 3G Restaurant Brands Holdings General Partner Ltd. may be deemed to have voting and dispositive power with respect to the reported securities held by 3G RBH. 3G Restaurant Brands Holdings General Partner Ltd. disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of its pecuniary interest therein, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that such Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of the securities for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or for any other purpose.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of RBI LP, 3G RBH delivered to RBI LP an exchange notice to exchange in aggregate 2,213,851 exchangeable units held by 3G RBH (the &quot;Exchange&quot;). As announced by RBI on February 27, 2023, upon receipt of the exchange notice, RBI, in its capacity as general partner of RBI LP, elected to have RBI LP satisfy the Exchange by issuing 2,213,851 common shares in exchange for 2,213,851 exchangeable units. The exchange notice became irrevocable on February 27, 2023 with respect to 2,213,851 exchangeable units. The Exchange will be effected on or before March 16, 2023.</footnote>

The Forward Contract obligates HL1 to deliver to the buyer 2,213,851 common shares of RBI (the &quot;Forward Shares&quot;) on the scheduled settlement date of March 16, 2023 or such earlier date as elected by HL1 in accordance with the terms of the Forward Contract. In exchange, HL1 will receive a cash payment based on a price per share of $63.99 multiplied by a factor of (1+ (an overnight bank funding rate minus a negotiated spread)) for each day that the Forward Contract is outstanding. Each Reporting Person disclaims all right, title and interest with respect to the Forward Contract transaction and nothing set forth herein shall be an admission that such Reporting Person has beneficial ownership of the Forward Shares or any transaction relating thereto.</footnote>
