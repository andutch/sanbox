owned subsidiary of Parent (&quot;Merger Sub&quot;), including the consummation of the merger (the &quot;Merger&quot;) between Issuer and Merger Sub on
February 22, 2023. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of the effective time of the Merger (the &quot;Effective Time&quot;), each share of Issuer
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (&quot;Shares&quot;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted

At the Effective Time, any unvested shares subject to the option was accelerated in full.</footnote>

At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU that was unvested was accelerated in full and was automatically converted in to the right to receive the Merger Consideration.</footnote>
