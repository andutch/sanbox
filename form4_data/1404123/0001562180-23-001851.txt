meeting of stockholders if the reporting person's service as a director ends at such meeting due to the director's failure to be re-elected or the
director not standing for re-election); or (ii) the one-year anniversary measured from the date of grant. At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU that was unvested was accelerated in full and was automatically converted in to the right to receive the Merger Consideration.</footnote>
