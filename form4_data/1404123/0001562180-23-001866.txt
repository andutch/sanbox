        <footnote id="F1">Reflects disposition of Issuer common stock with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
&quot;Merger Agreement&quot;), dated as of July 20, 2022, by and among Issuer, Amazon.com, Inc. (&quot;Parent&quot;) and Negroni Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (&quot;Merger Sub&quot;), including the consummation of the merger (the &quot;Merger&quot;) between Issuer and Merger Sub on
February 22, 2023. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of the effective time of the Merger (the &quot;Effective Time&quot;), each share of Issuer
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (&quot;Shares&quot;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted
automatically into the right to receive $18.00 in cash, without interest (the &quot;Merger Consideration&quot;).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option (&quot;Option&quot;) to purchase Shares granted under any of the Issuer's 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, 2020 Equity Incentive Plan and the Iora Third Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (collective, the &quot;Issuer Stock Plans&quot;) or portion thereof that was vested or became vested as of the Effective Time, and had an exercise price per Share that is less than the Merger Consideration, was canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the applicable exercise price per Share of such Option and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares issuable upon exercise of such Option or portion thereof, subject to any required withholding of taxes.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding Option that was unvested and that had an exercise price per Share that was less than the Merger Consideration was, by virtue of the Merger, converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per Share of such Option and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such unvested Option or portion thereof as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the &quot;Unvested Option Payment&quot;), provided that such Unvested Option Payment (x) shall be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to such unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (y) shall vest in installments over the remainder of the vesting schedule of such Option based on the same percentage of the Option that would have vested on each applicable vesting date, subject to any required withholding of taxes.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">The shares subject to the option vest as follows: 63% of the shares subject to the option vest ratably on a monthly basis from the vesting commencement date through August 2023; 25% of the shares subject to the option vest ratably on a monthly basis from September 2023 to August 2024; and the remaining 12% of the shares subject to the option vest ratably on a monthly basis from September 2024 to August 2025, subject to reporting person's continuous service as of each such date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each Option, whether vested or unvested, that has an exercise price per Share that is
greater than the Merger Consideration was canceled without the payment of consideration.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F6">The stock option vests, if at all, (1) as to 1/84th of the shares in equal monthly increments over the first seven years from the date of grant, and
(2) the achievement of four stock price milestones (with an equal or greater number of shares subject to vesting with respect to each higher
stock price milestone). Once a stock price milestone is met, then vesting for that portion of the grant meeting that stock price milestone becomes
subject solely to the time-based vesting requirement. No shares will vest with respect to the portion of the performance-based stock option for
which the applicable stock price milestone is not met.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F7">Each restricted stock unit (&quot;RSU&quot;) represents a contingent right to receive one share of the issuer's common stock. RSUs convert into the
issuer's common stock on a one-for-one basis.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F8">The RSUs vest annually over four years, with 50% of the RSUs units vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date; 20% vesting on the second anniversary of the grant date; and 15% vesting on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to reporting person's continuous service as of each such date. At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU that was unvested was forfeited for no consideration.</footnote>
